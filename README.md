# KI-67_Image_Classifier

The work focuses on training deep learning models to classify the Immunohistoslides of Ki-67 protein cells to automate the process of classifying the slides as benign and malignant. Using the PyTorch framework, the dataset was populated and trained on multiple pre-trained model in order to find the best effective model. The work culminated in a research paper, which was presented in the COCONet 2023.
